This is the brief answer:
1. You type maps.google.com into the address bar of your browser.
2. The browser checks the cache for a DNS (Domain Name System) record to find the corresponding IP address of maps.google.com.
3. If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISP’s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts maps.google.com.
4. Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server.
5. The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
6. The server handles the request and sends back a response.
7. The server sends out an HTTP response.
8. The browser displays the HTML content (for HTML responses which is the most common).

Why do we need a DNS?
The Domain Name System (DNS) is often referred to as the backbone of the internet. It’s run by many engineers and their organizations, it ultimately shapes the future of the internet. We need DNS because it manages the whole process of how the internet works and how it is organized (we can use the example of what happens when you type in google.com and press enter)

Explain TCP, and why it is a necessary protocol
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of allows anyone with a computer, modem, and an Internet service provider to access and share information over the Internet.Both TCP and IP, two separate protocols that work hand-in-hand, perform chores that manage and guide the general mobility of data packets over the Internet.
