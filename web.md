This is the brief answer:
1. You type maps.google.com into the address bar of your browser.
2. The browser checks the cache for a DNS (Domain Name System) record to find the corresponding IP address of maps.google.com.
3. If the requested URL is not in the cache, ISPâ€™s DNS server initiates a DNS query to find the IP address of the server that hosts maps.google.com.
4. Browser initiates a TCP connection with the server.
5. The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
6. The server handles the request and sends back a response.
7. The server sends out an HTTP response.
8. The browser displays the HTML content (for HTML responses which is the most common).
