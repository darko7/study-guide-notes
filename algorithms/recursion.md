 What exactly is a Stack Overflow?
 If the base case is not reached, the memory is exhausted by these functions on stack and it will cause stack overflow error.

  Describe direct and indirect recursion
  A function is called direct recursive if it calls the same function. A function is called indirect recursive if it calls another function and that function calls our first function directly or indirectly.
